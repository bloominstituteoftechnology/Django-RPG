# Django-RPG



For this assignment, you'll be exploring some test data in a Django RPG.

In the RPG, get into your pipenv shell, install dependencies from the Pipfile
using `pipenv install`.

You'll need a `.env` file to run this. The following should work:

```
SECRET_KEY='a secret key, see below'
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

You can make a secret key by running this in the Python REPL:

```python
import random
''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)]) # All one line!
```

Set up the database schema using `./manage.py migrate`. At this point the app
should work, and you can try a few other `./manage.py` commands to verify this.

But you don't have any data yet - there is test data that has been serialized
and saved to a file `testdata.json` at the base of the RPG repo. You can load
this with `./manage.py loaddata testdata.json`.

This test data has dozens-to-hundreds of randomly generated characters across
the base classes (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Thief) as well as a few
Necromancers. Also generated are Items, Weapons, and connections from characters
to them. Note that, while the name field was randomized, the numeric and boolean
fields were left as defaults.

You should familiarize yourself a bit with these classes and objects - read the
`models.py` files in the `armory/` and `charactercreator/` apps, and interact
with the data using the Django shell (`./manage.py shell`). Use the `dir()` and
`help()` functions to see what fields and methods are accessible. The official
documentation steps through how to query using the Django ORM, including how to
filter and span relationships (the equivalent of JOIN in SQL).

Your main goal is to write Python code that uses the Django ORM to answer:

* [ ] How many total Characters are there?
* [ ] How many of each specific subclass?
* [ ] How many total Items?
* [ ] How many of the Items are weapons? How many are not?
* [ ] On average, how many Items does each Character have?
* [ ] On average, how many Weapons does each character have?

You can experiment/execute your code using the Django shell. Please turn in a
file `queries.py` in this repo with your code along with comments for your
answers.

Stretch goals:

* [ ] Answer the same questions using the Django db shell/SQL (turn in
  `queries.sql`)
* [ ] Do queries that filter/group on substrings (e.g. how many item names
  contain "quid")
* [ ] Add views/templates for a "dashboard" that reports the stats (pulling data
  from the database, so it updates if that data changes)
* [ ] Using tables or charts, summarize answers to the above
* [ ] Slice the Items/Weapon distribution by Character subclass
* [ ] Play with populating your own test data - this data was generated using
  https://github.com/volrath/django-autofixture (this fork is compatible with
  Django 2.0 and is installed by the requirements.txt in the testdata branch,
  but you may still need dependencies such as gdal-bin (search for how to
  install this for your specific platform))
* [ ] In general, this exercise is meant to test your ability to navigate and
  investigate data in a Django application. If you get to the stretch goal of
  using autofixture, the practical application here is testing - you can have
  tests that generate unique random data each time, ensuring the robustness of
  your application.
